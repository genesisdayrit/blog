## What I'm working on

Currently, I am a fractional head of data / ai engineer / generalist consultant for tech companies. 

My core skillset is in data engineering, however, I have been developing more full-stack skills and AI skills over the past year.

Feel free to reach out about opportunities to collaborate at genesis@data-lab.co.
